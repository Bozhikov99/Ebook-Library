# Ebook-Library
This is an ASP.NET Core Web application project that is an online subscription based book reading service.
The web application will allow you to read books online for a periodic subscription, you can place reviews on books and search specific titles, genres and authors.

The solution is built upon ASP.NET Core and features a MVC application and an API. We've used the MedatR with CQRS approach to achieve Clean Architecture for its realization. 

Cooperation of Bozhikov99 and Heathen-Source.
