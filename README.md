# Ebook-Library
This is an ASP.NET Core Web application project that is an online subscription based book reading service.
The web application will allow you to read books online for a periodic subscription, you can place reviews on books and search specific titles, genres and authors.

It's build upon ASP.NET Core and features a MVC application and an API. We've used the MedatR with CQRS approach to achieve Clean Architecture for its realization. 

The project is currently being restructured to follow the principles of the Clean Architecture and further improve the quality of its code.
